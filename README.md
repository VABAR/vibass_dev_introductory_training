# Pedagogical approach of the course Introduction to Bayesian analysis


## Objective of the training


> What participants will be able to __do__ after the training, that were not
able to do before. Avoid verbs like _know_ or _understand_ and focus instead on
what this knowledge or understanding enable people to perform.

At the end of the course, participants will be able to start applying Bayesian
methods to simple models in their field, having acquired an understanding of
Bayesian concepts and becoming aware of the possibilities for more specific and
more complex methods for in-depth analysis.


## Operational goals

> What specific skills (again, in terms of __action__ verbs) are necessary to
develop during the training in order to achieve the overall goal above.

1. Identify the "Bayesian building blocks" (prior, likelihood, posterior,
predictive) in any Bayesian analysis and interpret their meaning correctly.

1. Assess the appropriateness of the basic distributions from the exponential
family for the various types of data (count, binary, continuous).

1. Summarise inferences and predictions of quantities of interest and derived
functions using random samples from posterior probability distributions.

1. Interpret the information contained in a posterior probability distribution
by visual inspection of its shape in a plot of the density or mass function.

1. Synthesise the main characteristics of three core approaches for Bayesian
computation: analytical conjugate derivations, Importance Sampling and Markov
Chain Monte Carlo.

1. Apply basic Importance Sampling and MCMC methods via available software for
fitting regression models

1. Assess the convergence quality of the Markov Chains by visual inspection of
their traces and by convergence indices like $\hat R$.

1. Summarise the landscape of available software packages, and their
characteristics.

    Specifically, whether they are flexible probabilistic programming languages
    (Bugs, Stan, Nimble, ...) or interfaces to a closed set of families of
    statistical models, and their relative strengths and weaknesses.

1. Identify in which situations Bayesian analysis is particularly advantageous
with respect to frequentist alternatives.

    Specifically, the direct probabilistic interpretation of results, the
    treatment of the uncertainty in the model parameters (e.g. proper
    propagation, rather than marginalisation using MLEs), not relying on
    asymptotic theory, the probabilistic approach to hypothesis testing.


## Pre-requisites

- Target population: people with little to no previous knowledge of Bayesian statistics with some concrete motivation.

	E.g. master/PhD students who are going to use or work with Bayesian statistics, professionals in various fields (medicine, biology, ecology, industry, etc.) wanting to improve their quantitative skills.
