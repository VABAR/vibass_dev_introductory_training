# Pedagogical approach of the course Introduction to Bayesian analysis

## Goal of the training

> What participants will be able to __do__ after the training, that were not able to do before. Avoid verbs like _know_ or _understand_ and focus instead on what this knowledge or understanding enable people to perform.

At the end of the course, participants will be able to start using Bayesian statistics in their field, having acquired the foundations needed to learn and understand more specific methods and models.


## Operational goals

> What specific skills (again, in terms of __action__ verbs) are necessary to develop during the training in order to achieve the overall goal above.

1. Identify the "Bayesian building blocks" (prior, likelihood, posterior, predictive) in any Bayesian analysis and interpret their meaning correctly.

1. Assess the appropriateness of the basic distributions from the exponential family for the various types of data (count, binary, continuous).

1. Summarise inferences and predictions using random samples.

1. Obtain samples of functions of parameters using random samples.

1. Interpret the information contained in a probability distribution by visual inspection of its density or mass function.

1. Assess the compatibility or discrepancy between probability distributions by visual inspection of their densities or mass functions.

1. Synthesise the main characteristics of the three basic methods for Bayesian computation: analytical conjugate derivations, Importance Sampling and Metropolis Hastings. 

1. Adapt basic IS and MH algorithms for fitting (generalised) linear regression models by sequentially sampling from each of them.

1. Distinguish the _proposal_ distribution in Importance Sampling from the _prior_ distribution, and assess its performance using the effective sample size.

1. Fit hierarchical models with Bayesian software like INLA or BayesX.



## Pre-requisites

- Target population: people with little to no previous knowledge of Bayesian statistics with some concrete motivation.

	E.g. master/PhD students who are going to use or work with Bayesian statistics, professionals in various fields (medicine, biology, ecology, industry, etc.) wanting to improve their quantitative skills.


## Questions

Do you think that:

1. the __goal of the training__ completely and accurately covers what we want the participant to achieve with the training?

2. the __operational goals__ described above are necessary and sufficient to achieve the goal of the training?

3. what we __actually do__ in the course is necessary and sufficient to achieve the operational goals?
